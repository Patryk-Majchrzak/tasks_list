So, what are you waiting for? Click th link in the demo and try it out üòâ

## Details for users
1. Website is available only in polish (I am about to add language selection in thee future, so it will be available in english as well)
2. After starting the website for the first time, you should see two example tasks called "zrobiƒá co≈õ" (do something) and "zrobiƒá co≈õ innego" (do something else). "Zrobiƒá co≈õ innego" should be crossed out as it is marked as done. Also there will be two options called "ukryj uko≈Ñczone" (hide done) and uko≈Ñcz wszystkie (finish all). You should see same two tasks after refreshing the page

## Details for developers

1. JavaScript code has been closed in a block to avoid setting global functions or variables
2. All JS interactions are closed in separated functions with function init called as a first one and then calling one further interactions
3. For naming classes for HTML mark-ups I've used BEM convention for any class I was using in CSS. For classes used in JS I used prefixes "js-". All of them are written in camelCase
4. I used media queries to change how website will be displayed on various devices
5. Code has been written with regard to immutability. Arrays and objects aren't modified, they are replaced with new ones
