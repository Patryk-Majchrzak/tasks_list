## Details for developers

1. JavaScript code has been closed in a block to avoid setting global functions or variables
2. All JS interactions are closed in separated functions with function init called as a first one and then calling one further interactions
3. For naming classes for HTML mark-ups I've used BEM convention for any class I was using in CSS. For classes used in JS I used prefixes "js-". All of them are written in camelCase
4. I used media queries to change how website will be displayed on various devices
